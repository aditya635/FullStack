->admin for admin view
->models for DB

Made the challenge project
made a function in view.py which holds the views and HttpResponse is basically
sending a reponse back to browser after recieving request
Sent a string back without using a query in the function

Created urls.py in app made a list and import views.py so that we can call 
the view's function for a request we get set path variable in list which 
holds the urls

now we have to connect both urlconfigs in app 
and config folder(monthly_challenges) also use include from urls
1)use path in config folder in urls.py to call challenges app
the include the urls.py file of that app with include to include all urls
